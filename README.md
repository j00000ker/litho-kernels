# litho-kernels
Computes the optimal coherent approximation (OCA) for any given photolithography system.

## Using litho-kernels
To directly use the library functions, use
```
import oca
```

## Standalone scripts
* `compute_oca`: Compute optical kernels and coefficients for a lithography system described with a .json file.
* `compare_mentor.py`: Compare kernel computation with MentorGraphics results.
